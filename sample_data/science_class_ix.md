## Chapter 1: Cell Structure and Function

### The Cell

The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Cells were first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665.

### Cell Organelles

#### Mitochondria

The mitochondria is known as the **powerhouse of the cell**. It is responsible for:

1. **Energy Production**: Mitochondria produce ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) through cellular respiration
2. **Metabolic Functions**: They play a crucial role in breaking down nutrients
3. **Cell Signaling**: Mitochondria are involved in cell signaling and cellular differentiation

The structure of mitochondria includes:
- Outer membrane
- Inner membrane with cristae
- Matrix containing enzymes

#### Nucleus

The nucleus is the control center of the cell. It contains:
- DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
- Nucleolus
- Nuclear membrane

The nucleus controls all cellular activities and is responsible for heredity.

#### Ribosomes

Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis. They can be:
- Free-floating in the cytoplasm
- Attached to the endoplasmic reticulum

## Chapter 2: Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food. The general equation is:

6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

### Chloroplasts

Chloroplasts are the organelles where photosynthesis occurs. They contain chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color.

## Chapter 3: Cell Division

Cell division is the process by which cells reproduce. There are two types:

1. **Mitosis**: Results in two identical daughter cells
2. **Meiosis**: Results in four non-identical daughter cells with half the chromosome number

### Importance of Cell Division

- Growth and development
- Repair and replacement of damaged cells
- Reproduction in unicellular organisms
